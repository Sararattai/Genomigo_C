Symbol Table - Design
=============================

1. Introduction 
This document captures the design of the requirements and functional specification documented in requirements.docx and FunctionalSpec.docx

2. Recognize a text line content



2.1. Lexical Analyzer

Read and parse User Records
	Read one line
		Read one character at a time

	Loop through each character and identify the individual tokens seperated by comma (,) or space



2. Parser
The parser phase constructs a SymbolTable and other artifacts.

In a SymbolTable, a symbol is used as a key and the metadata such as its length, along with its metrics are stored as value.
