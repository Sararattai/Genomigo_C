Symbol Table - Functional Spec
=============================

1. Introduction

This document captures the Functional Spec to meet the requirements sepcified in Requirements.txt

The input text lines would be converted into records.

A User record is an instance of the 'struct User' and a AutoSomo is an instance of the 'struct AutoSomo'

2.1 Input 
An input to the program is a text line. 

A text line contains different kinds of data such as following
	1. User Profile:
		Header - First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State, Zip, DOB
		A sample line is - John,Li,Jacaranda Dr,Fremont,94539,510 453 3434,1998/2/23

	2. Auto Somo:
		Header - RSID,CHROMOSOME,POSITION,RESULT
		A sample line is - "rs4477212","1","72017","AA"

Please note that the "User Profile" line doesn't have the fields enclosed within quotes ("") but the "Auto Somo".  

2.2. Output

	struct User 
	{

	} ;

	struct AutoSomo 
	{
